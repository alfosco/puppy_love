# Puppy Love

Puppy Love is a Ruby-on-Rails application that connects users to shelter dogs close to them that are in need of a loving home. It uses Google OAuth to authenticate users. It consumes the PetFinder API to provide information on shelter dogs to users. It also uses the Google Maps API to display the location of the shelters the dogs are located at.

It can be used live on Heroku [here](https://pup-love.herokuapp.com/)
